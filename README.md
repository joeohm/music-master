# Music master

A React project for browsing artists from Spotify. I did this project to learn React class components, and how to integrate with Spotify Developer API.  
The search result allows you to play a preview of each song, if a preview exists in the Spotify API.

Made together with https://github.com/15Dkatz/spotify-api-wrapper  
Since the the spotify-api-wrapper was not working (open issue that has since been resolved), I copied it and hosted my own API wrapper in Heroku.
